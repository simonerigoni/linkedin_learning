## Running the code

Using `make_directories_and_files.py` I have created the directory structure for all the challenges. With the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) `python_code_challenges.ipynb` is possible to have an overview of all challenges

Some challengs were suitable to automated test using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
